# Go Tour
 
This is where i'll add all the basic knowledge from the go tour

## Commands
```
$ go get <github.com/user/project>      //download and install packages and dependencies
```

```
$ go build      // test that the package compiles (compile packages and dependencies)
```

```
$ go install    // build and install that program 
```

```
$ go test       // run the test
```

```
$ go run        // compile and run Go program
```

```
$ go doc        // show documentation for package or symbol
```

## Testing

Create a file *_test.go, containing functions named "TestXXX" with signature (t *Testing.T)
**If the function calls a failure function such as t.Error or t.Fail, the test is considered to have failed.**
